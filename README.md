# CTA_Project

This project is a continuation of the CTA Purple Line Delay Propagation Analysis that I did for my Transportation and Logistics minor research paper at Northwestern Univeristy in the Spring of my Senior year. I plan on hosting an analytics dashboard in AWS using data from the CTA Train Tracker API as was used in the paper.

If you wish to read the paper displaying my findings from that time, it is included as a pdf.
